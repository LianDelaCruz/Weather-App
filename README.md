# Weather-App :sun_behind_rain_cloud:

Oh, hello there!
This App is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
I enjoyed creating this, and I also made my mom and my friends use it! 

### What the project does:
You have arrived in my weather app. :sunglasses: This website will show you the weather in a city that you wanna search for. It fetches the data from a weather API and it changes the background image depending on the time. 

### Why the project is useful: 
I think this is one of my precious app that I made. It is not the most perfect, but it does search for city weather and give information. 

### How users can get started with the project
It might not work right now because I only used a trial period for the access in the weather api. :) But I will work on it soon!

### Where users can get help with your project:
You can contact me! 

### Who maintains and contributes to the project:
It was only me. Feel free to check out my other repos!
