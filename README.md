# Weather-App

Oh, hello there!

You have arrived in my weather app. :) 
This App is created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The main purpose of this project is to fetch data from the API to get the weather from an specific city. 
I enjoyed creating this, and I also made my mom used it! 

It might not work right now because I only used a trial period for the access in the weather api. :) 

Feel free to check out my other repos! and here is a link for my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/liandelacruz/

Cheers! Thank you for visiting!
